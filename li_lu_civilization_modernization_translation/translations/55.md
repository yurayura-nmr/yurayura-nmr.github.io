...would be close to 100%. Berners-Lee also came to the TED conference this year and, quite uniquely, shared the stage with a robotic "avatar" of Edward Snowden. On the 25th anniversary of the internet, he proposed that we need an "Internet Magna Carta" to protect it from excessive government interference. He hopes to crowdsource the best ideas for this charter through the cloud and ultimately have all major governments adhere to it.

I feel incredibly fortunate to have personally witnessed this great process of human development over the past 25 years, first as a patriotic student, and then as a venture capitalist on the front lines witnessing the birth and growth of the internet. I have become close friends with many of the people leading these changes, observing each milestone up close, personally feeling how quickly they happen and how profoundly they change lives.

The two main drivers of human development are human intelligence and ambition. Those at the forefront pushing human progress are usually people who are exceptionally intelligent, ambitious, and possess the altruistic gene that anthropologist Edward Wilson spoke of. It is precisely this force that has evolved us from clumsy monkeys into the rulers of Earth. On the TED stage, you meet many such people; they attract and inspire each other like magnets.

Marvin Minsky was right, the soul is just a pile of cells, but the cells that make up the souls of these people are extraordinary. Together, they have invented machines that greatly extend human muscular power, and are now on the front lines researching how to extend the power of the human brain. Through bioengineering, they can even bring extinct species back to life. They are even seriously considering establishing human colonies on other planets. Everything we witness at TED is the present tense of the ongoing process of human evolution. Now we can not only directly participate but, to some extent, even control its direction.

Finally, as a long-time TED participant, I have also found a new identity here. After coming to the US 25 years ago, I struggled for a long time, unsure whether I was Chinese or American. A few years ago, I began to understand that I am both completely 100% Chinese and purely 100% American, and 1+1>2. In today's globalized world, we are all global citizens, part of the human family, now beginning to awaken to concern for the fate of other species and responsibility for Mother Earth, yet still yearning to build new human homes on distant planets beyond. This is the historical coordinate point we are at today. If you don't agree with this view today, technological development itself will convince you someday in the future.

**Human Nature and the Financial Crisis**
— New Year's Reflections 2016

At the beginning of 2016, I watched the movie *The Big Short*. The film, adapted from Michael Lewis's novel of the same name, tells the legendary story of several investors who were the first to discover the vulnerabilities in the 2007-2008 subprime mortgage crisis and the entire US financial system, and profited by shorting it. I personally experienced many of the events depicted in the film; I have interacted, to varying degrees, with the various characters in the film, so watching it felt more immersive and realistic, which sparked some reflections.

Starting around 2005-2006, I also discovered Credit Default Swaps (CDS) by chance, did some research, and once prepared to enter on a large scale to short via CDS. Later, after several conversations with Charlie Munger, I gradually abandoned this idea. Charlie's reason for opposition was simple: if my analysis was correct, it meant that either the counterparties holding these products, the large financial companies, might go bankrupt and fail to pay; or these large financial institutions would be bailed out by the government using taxpayers' money, in which case the money you made would essentially come from taxpayers and the government, which wouldn't feel right. Later events confirmed Charlie's judgment: those who made money from this historically largest short ultimately received it directly or indirectly from global taxpayers. Therefore, I have never regretted not making money from taxpayers.

Investment itself is a prediction of the future. While being right in prediction brings some pleasure, the results of different ways of making money are still different. Later, after Michael Lewis's book was published, I had several more exchanges with Charlie about that decision. He said that if you had made a lot of money from CDS then, you might still be looking for the next big short opportunity today. Human nature is like that. Hedge fund investor John Paulson was the biggest winner of this big short. In recent years, observing Paulson's performance since 2008 has once again verified Charlie's judgment. "A gentleman loves wealth, but acquires it in the right way" refers not only to the method of making money but also, in Charlie's view, the source of the money is equally important. On this point, I deeply agree. The money made by these big shorts was ultimately filled by the broad taxpayer base. Ordinary taxpayers were both the biggest victims of this global financial crisis and the ones who ultimately paid for it. Making money in such a crisis is truly不忍心 (unbearable to the conscience). But this searing experience made me even more apprehensive about the dangers of the financial industry.

More importantly, the film uses the experiences of the short sellers as a starting point to reveal the various human affairs in the 2008 global financial crisis triggered by the US and the profound human nature reasons that led to this crisis.

This financial crisis was largely caused by the characteristics of the financial industry. Unlike any other service industry, financial products are very difficult for most people to judge as good or bad most of the time. This creates a natural breeding ground for corruption in the financial industry. The 2008 global financial crisis originating from the US is just the most extreme recent example. Friends working in finance, whether this film has been released domestically or not, should find a way to watch it.

The Englishman Lord Acton famously said: "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely." Over twenty years of experience in the financial industry often makes me feel that the power imbalance caused by information asymmetry, coupled with the huge temptation of financial profits, corrupts the entire financial industry even more and can trigger systemic financial crises.

However, at least before 2008, mainstream thinking among Western regulators tended to believe that the free market economy was equally applicable within the financial industry, so less intervention or non-intervention was preferred. This view was most championed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.

The free market economy is certainly one of the greatest institutional innovations in human history, but there are indeed exceptions. These exceptions are defined as market failures. But so far, market failures are considered to exist mainly in public services, natural monopolies, and externalities, with less discussion about market failures in the financial sector. However, based on my personal experience and observation, market failures actually exist widely in financial markets. Therefore, in the financial sector, negative-list freedom is often more destructive than positive-list freedom. The 2008-2009 global financial crisis was an extreme lesson.

In 2015, which we just experienced, the extreme use of leverage in China's off-exchange financing also gave the nation a scare. If the government had not taken strong measures in time, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

Recently, due to a well-known acquisition incident, I had the opportunity to read some so-called universal life insurance product contracts from insurance companies. Reading them sent chills down my spine. If I were in the regulator's position today, the prevalence of such products would keep me up at night.

The financial market is a mechanism that exposes the weaknesses of human nature, and this has not changed since the moment modern financial markets were born. Today, financial mixed operations in China seem inevitable, and direct finance will also become one of the most important drivers for the development of the real economy in the future. Against this backdrop, from financial regulators to financial practitioners, we should be more vigilant about the challenges the financial industry itself poses to human nature. Due to the characteristics of human nature, financial liberalization will inevitably lead to corruption; absolute financial liberalization often leads to massive financial crises.

I am not advocating absolute financial control, nor am I arguing that free markets should not play an important role in the financial industry. But all historical experience shows that maintaining a high degree of vigilance against the inherent risks of the financial industry is always a wise strategy. 2016 is the first year of China's 13th Five-Year Plan. Market-based direct financing will become more important, and mixed operations are becoming a trend. In this context, I write these reflections as a self-examination for the start of 2016.

**Reflecting on Our Times**

In the past week or two, a series of major events have occurred rapidly. Superficially, these events seem random. But when connected, I must stop and ponder the era we live in.

On February 22, NASA discovered a new solar system. This solar system is only 40 light-years away from us and has seven Earth-like planets, meaning there could be life on these planets. A few days later, on February 27, Elon Musk announced that SpaceX will send a Dragon II spacecraft with two paying customers to lunar orbit in 2018. This will be the first manned mission to return to the Moon since the end of the Apollo program in 1972.

A few days later, on March 1, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that the Antarctic temperature hit a new record high: 63.5 degrees Fahrenheit (17.5 degrees Celsius)! 90% of the Earth's freshwater exists as glaciers in the Arctic. If these glaciers melt, sea levels could rise by 200 feet. On the same day, scientists discovered microfossils in ancient Canadian rocks. This discovery pushes the origin of life on Earth further back, to between 3.77 and 4.28 billion years ago, meaning life emerged on Earth under hellish conditions not long after its formation 4.5 billion years ago!

Back on Earth, on March 3, China began its annual Two Sessions. During this period, the Chinese government once again pledged to lift 10 million people out of poverty in 2017 and eradicate poverty entirely by 2020. If this goal is achieved, it will be a first in China's 5000-year history—remember, nearly one-fifth of the Earth's population lives on this land. On the same day, the US National Academy of Medicine launched a grand challenge on human aging and longevity, offering a $25 million prize to catalyze scientific research beneficial to human health and longevity.

As if arranged by fate to help me better understand these events, last Tuesday I was invited to a dinner hosted by the Berggruen Institute, where I discussed his new book *Homo Deus* with Professor Yuval Noah Harari. On Thursday evening, a dinner conversation with an old friend, Juan Enriquez, gave me many insights. Juan is one of the most important thinkers of our time, author of *Evolving Ourselves: How Unnatural Selection and Nonrandom Mutation are Changing Life on Earth*. Then, on Friday evening, I was honored to attend the launch dinner for the US National Academy of Medicine's "Grand Challenge on Human Longevity" project. The dinner was held at the home of the 95-year-old Hollywood legend Norman Lear (could there be a more fitting venue?). Other guests included entrepreneurial leaders, venture capitalists, Nobel laureates, musicians, thinkers, and artists from across the country. All these encounters are helping me better contemplate and understand our times.

Since 1900, global average life expectancy has more than doubled, reaching around 70 years (about 10 years longer in developed countries). In other words, in just over 100 years, the increase in human lifespan has been greater than the total increase over the previous 100,000+ years of human history. This is a staggering achievement of modern civilization! However, in today's post-industrial world, about 9% of the global population still lives below the poverty line. The vast majority live in developing countries and cannot fully enjoy the benefits of modern life. This situation exists not because humanity as a whole has not created enough food to feed everyone, nor because the wealth created is insufficient for all to share. The reason is uneven wealth distribution.

Over the past 40 years, China's rapid economic development has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Equally important, China's practice has shown a new path of economic development for other countries, especially African countries and India.

However, rapid industrialization around the world has also led to unintended consequences, one of which is potentially warming the Earth to a point where it becomes uninhabitable for humans. It has long been believed that carbon dioxide emissions are the main culprit for global warming. However, latest research suggests that methane may be up to 10 times more effective than CO2 at trapping solar radiation in the ozone layer. Most of the Earth's methane is stored as frozen methane clathrate in the Siberian permafrost. Continued warming of the Earth could eventually release methane into the ozone layer, further accelerating global warming. According to latest estimates by leading climate scientists, rapid sea level rise is likely a matter of decades, not centuries as previously estimated.

In the US, developments in artificial intelligence and bioengineering are making a whole new future world for humanity no longer a fantasy: in this future world, humans are no longer willing to leave the paramount matter of "evolution" to random selection. Instead, we intentionally evolve ourselves into a higher form of intelligent being, continuously extending our lives towards immortality, equipped with bodies capable of adapting to life on different planets or even interstellar space. At the aforementioned launch dinner for the "Grand Challenge on Human Longevity," a prominent entrepreneur declared: "Death is optional!" Sounds like science fiction? Actually, no. Given the rapid development of AI and bioengineering technologies, we will soon reach and surpass the "singularity." It is no longer unimaginable that a part of us will split off from *Homo sapiens* to form a completely new species, which I will tentatively name "XYZ humans" (or Professor Harari's *Homo Deus*). But will this evolutionary opportunity be fair to all humans? When the Earth is no longer suitable for human habitation and interstellar travel becomes possible, will we mortal beings with finite lifespans have enough time to fly to other planets? Will "XYZ humans" treat those *Homo sapiens* less evolved than them kindly?
