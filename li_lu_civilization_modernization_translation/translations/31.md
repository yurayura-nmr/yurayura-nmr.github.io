*It refers to something you can predict correctly with a very high probability over a considerable period. If this condition cannot be met, you'd rather not touch it. So, from this perspective, value investing truly embodies a set of values, and one could even say it's a kind of faith.*

*If it is a faith, it must be validated, and in the process, you will inevitably undergo tests of despair. Therefore, your emotions will certainly fluctuate, at least in the beginning. But gradually, you will truly integrate it into your life, and the turbulence will slowly turn into imperturbability—unmoved by honor or disgrace. Led by your intense interest in the business itself, you will gradually build your own circle of competence. Once you operate with ease within this circle, you can focus single-mindedly, free from the interference of other noise. This is why I find that most truly successful investors are quite distant from financial centers, and the further away they are, the better their performance—take Omaha, for example. In fact, having less communication with people in financial centers like Beijing, Shanghai, New York, or Hong Kong might be more helpful. Those fancy-sounding trading theories are actually just noise. Why call it noise? Because the net result of speculation is zero. If you remember only one thing from my sharing today, let it be this concept of zero-sum—the net outcome of speculation is always zero. Although people don't mention it, this is the reality; it's a simple mathematical concept. Keep this in mind, and the next time you encounter those "high-sounding" theories, you can regard them as Mr. Market.* 

You'll find that Graham's personification of Mr. Market is actually quite fitting.

Finally, I want to say that the entire process of learning value investing has been particularly fascinating for me personally. Initially, for the sake of making a living, I stumbled into this industry by chance and coincidence. Upon entering, I discovered a whole new world—this industry truly has many incredible aspects that keep you learning new things constantly, allowing you to feel your knowledge and judgment growing compoundly. So, not only do you experience the compound growth of your assets, but you also feel your abilities, knowledge, and insights growing at a compound rate. In the investment industry, you can witness two types of compound growth phenomena that are uncommon in real life, which is very interesting.

When I was young, I was always searching for the meaning of life. Later, I gradually realized that the true meaning of life is the pursuit of true knowledge. Because true knowledge can change lives, alter destinies, and even transform the world. Moreover, humans are entirely different from other things we can observe and from the objective world. The material world we observe is essentially a world of entropy increase, where energy flows from high to low, the big always devour the small, a larger planet colliding with a smaller one will inevitably crush it, and eventually, the entire Earth and universe will reach a point of annihilation. But the human world is different; humans can turn the world into one of entropy decrease, making entropy flow backward. Through learning, humans can go from complete ignorance to erudition; through self-cultivation, they can become morally noble individuals who contribute to society; humans can also create so many new things that were previously unimaginable. Since humans arrived on Earth, the entire world and the planet have undergone tremendous changes. Today, we might even leave Earth and emigrate to space, potentially changing the universe—all of this is entirely possible. As mentioned earlier, my first investment was related to wireless telephones, although I didn't fully understand it at the time. Twenty-six years later, who can live without a mobile phone? Mobile phones, the internet—all these actually arose from a small piece of true knowledge, creating massive changes. The internet is essentially TCP/IP, just a protocol. The entire computer is a permutation and combination of 0s and 1s, plus diodes using silicon and electricity to determine whether it's 0 or 1—just this piece of true knowledge has turned the world upside down.

So, for me, the experience of investing has allowed me to truly feel humanity's process of entropy decrease. Investing, especially value investing on the right path, is actually a journey of personal entropy decrease. In this process, you can indeed help create; you can truly achieve "win-win" outcomes, benefiting not only yourself but also those around you. Moreover, the insights you support can make the human world completely different from the objective world inhabited by other beings. I think this is a particularly wonderful thing, and I want to share this feeling with everyone. I hope we can go far together on the path of value investing. Thank you!

## Q&A Session

**Q:** As a sell-side analyst with over a decade of experience in industry analysis, what challenges do I face when transitioning to value investing? How should I start? As an experienced professional, how do I switch gears?

The difference between sell-side and buy-side is essentially a psychological shift. Why do I have the mindset of a company owner? Because after buying my first stock, I realized the company was truly mine. Human psychology is like that; we feel differently about things we own. The same applies to the sell-side. If I'm always thinking about selling stocks because the company's incentive structure requires me to sell, then I'll always try to make my "pig" look prettier, maybe even call it a "unicorn." Of course, you might be selling something genuinely good, like if you research Moutai, which is indeed a great company. But psychologically, your primary goal is to sell it. In terms of human psychology, people's positions and their thinking are highly aligned, and this is hard to change. If it weren't the case, you'd feel too uncomfortable and wouldn't last anywhere. So, when transitioning from sell-side to buy-side—for example, I've seen many of my investment banking friends move into investing, mostly without much success—it's because they retain their investment banking mindset, primarily focused on selling ideas to others. Because they sell so well, they end up convincing themselves. People are like that. So, don't deceive yourself, because you are the easiest person to fool. When you excel at "selling to others," you often end up selling it to yourself—this is inevitable. That's why objectivity and rationality are particularly important.

How to be objective and rational? You need to shift your position. So, I think before formally transitioning, it's best to do some personal investing first to experience the psychological difference between the two. After some personal investing, you'll truly feel that the company is yours. Your thinking will start to diverge significantly from the sell-side mindset, and your approach to gathering information will change—it's like your antenna for receiving information starts to point in a different direction. When your antenna shifts, you'll find the information you collect is different too.

Therefore, I believe the first step is psychological adjustment. The best way is to start by doing it yourself. Before formally joining the ranks of value investing, make some investments on your own, but use value investing methods, not sell-side methods. The sell-side method is "the thing I want to sell is always the best." Without this mindset, it's hard to excel on the sell-side. So, when you meet an insurance salesperson, they see everyone as a potential client—why? Because that's how they succeed; it's unavoidable! So, the most important first step is psychological adjustment. When you feel that psychological change, you'll begin to break free from the shackles of the sell-side mindset.

However, your existing understanding of business and companies remains useful and accumulative. When you use an owner's antenna to reorganize information, you'll find that many information channels change, the information itself changes. Your knowledge is still useful, but the mental structure through which you organize this knowledge will undergo subtle changes, and these changes are particularly important. Without completing this step, it's difficult to transition directly to the buy-side.

**Q:** Studying failures helps us understand success. Have you encountered young people determined to practice value investing, especially those with the qualities you mentioned, who ultimately failed to persevere and failed? If so, why did they fail?

I've met many different people, and there are various reasons for failure. The main reason is interest. For someone to ultimately persevere and do something well, it must align with their interest. The direction most likely to lead to success is where you have both interest and ability. For example, some people might have the qualities for value investing but are more interested in other things. After learning about value investing for a while, they get drawn to something else. This is entirely possible, and I think it's a rational decision. I believe the most important thing isn't which industry makes more money. If you hold that notion, you'll jump around because there will always be someone making more money than you. If you judge based on how much money you make, you'll live a miserable life. So, ultimately, you must follow your interest. If your interest lies in value investing, as long as you're on this path, you'll generally go further and longer. But if the interest isn't there, the most common examples I've seen are indeed due to lack of interest. However, what they learn from value investing will be useful elsewhere, provided their temperament is somewhat suited to value investing.

**Q:** How do you determine whether you understand a company you're researching or not? Is there an objective criterion or principle to judge whether you truly understand it or just think you do?

Since what we do involves prediction, understanding or not understanding actually depends on whether your prediction is correct. But the answer isn't revealed immediately; it takes many years to uncover. If you are intellectually honest, you will persistently seek to uncover this answer, so you will naturally know whether you truly understand or not. My standard for my company's employees is: if your research on a company reaches a state of understanding, you should be able to see what its worst-case scenario will be in 10 years. The best-case scenario often happens naturally, so you need to understand the worst it could be in a decade. If I can't do this, I can't really claim to understand the company. But the probability of my prediction being correct must be very high; I must be correct with a very high probability, and I must follow it for 10 years to see if my prediction holds true.

So, this is indeed a difficult question. Where does the difficulty lie? In the many innate psychological tendencies humans have. Mr. Munger, in the translated version of *Poor Charlie's Almanac*, specifically lists 25 innate human psychological tendencies, and there might be even more. These tendencies exist because our brains are largely a product of natural selection and design. The primary function of a naturally selected brain is to enable us to produce more offspring and survive. But our current state of living is actually a result of cultural evolution. We already live in a highly civilized society, where many rules of cultural evolution differ from those of biological evolution. Therefore, our innate psychological tendencies have many flaws that prevent us from making very objective, rational judgments. This is why, in learning and research, we indeed encounter the problem raised by this student: he thinks he understands, but he actually doesn't realize his own blind spots. Not realizing these blind spots leads to him ultimately being proven wrong—he actually doesn't really understand.

So, when you think you understand something, you must first know what you don't understand, because what we understand is certainly limited. The most important concept of the circle of competence is that it has boundaries; it's a circle. If you don't know where the boundaries of this circle are and claim to understand everything, then you certainly don't understand. You must also understand that when you know something is correct, you must know when it could be wrong. Mr. Munger has a standard that I find quite useful. He said if I want to have an opinion, I must be able to rebut it better than the smartest person I can find who opposes this opinion. Only under such circumstances do I deserve to have this opinion. I think this is a good standard. You can use this standard to judge whether you understand or not. You can think in reverse: can I find the smartest person I know to refute what I claim to understand, and then find that his reasoning is inferior to mine, that I can rebut even more effectively? At that point, it's possible—though not entirely certain—that you truly understand.

But you must know when your understanding might be wrong. In other words, you must know that your ability indeed lies within a circle. If you don't understand the boundaries of your circle of competence, you actually don't understand, because you can't possibly understand everything. This might sound abstract, but it becomes very practical when applied to specific issues. Several colleagues from our company are here; each has experienced the questions I ask. My questions will inevitably push you to the boundary; if you're not pushed to the boundary, you can't truly understand. This relies on intellectual honesty and requires constant training; it's hard to achieve immediately. If you don't use this way of thinking in life, it's indeed not easy to achieve true understanding. This habit is particularly helpful for a person throughout their life.

**Q:** You just talked about how to achieve true understanding. You also mentioned earlier that value investing is a learning process. Could you share what learning methods to use to experience the compound growth of knowledge?

Useful knowledge must meet several basic conditions. First, it must be verifiable; its logic and the facts you observe must support it. Furthermore, it must be able to explain things, possessing strong explanatory power. Simultaneously, it must have reasonably useful predictive ability. So, in real life, the most useful knowledge that meets these criteria is scientific knowledge. Scientific knowledge indeed satisfies all the above standards. But most phenomena we encounter in real life lack a basis in scientific theory because the things we deal with are more or less related to humans, and human-related matters are more or less a distribution of probabilities. When we learn mathematics, calculus isn't too important, but statistics must be mastered. Because almost all problems encountered in reality are statistical problems. Returning to the question: what learning methods should we use to study these real-life problems? You still need to use scientific methods, but you must know that the results you get are fuzzy. You'd rather have fuzzy correctness than precise error. You must use scientific methods to learn; this remains the most effective way to accumulate knowledge.

Another method I find most useful is to let your interest guide you. When you have a strong interest in something, you can accumulate knowledge in that area more efficiently than anyone else in a relatively short time and perform better than everyone else. Because when you ultimately use this knowledge, it will still be in a competitive environment; your judgment about something will still be compared to others' judgments. When you have a strong interest in something, you might still be thinking about it when others have stopped learning; you might still be striving when others are satisfied.
