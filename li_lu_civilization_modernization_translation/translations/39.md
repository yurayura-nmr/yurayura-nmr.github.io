**Probabilistic Advantage.** Nothing is ever one hundred percent certain, but if you possess an overwhelming advantage with every swing (decision), then over time, you will do exceptionally well.

**II. How to Generate Investment Ideas**

**Q: Could you talk about your investment process?**

My ideas come from all aspects of life, but primarily from reading and conversations. I don't care how they come about, as long as they are good ideas. You can discover good ideas through extensive reading, researching many companies, or learning from smart people—preferably those smarter than you, especially those who are outstanding in their respective fields. I read as widely as possible, study all the great companies I'm interested in, and talk to many smart people. And then, guess what? Sometimes, during certain readings or conversations, a light bulb goes off. What follows is more in-depth research. Sometimes you become more convinced, other times it's the opposite.

**Q: Do you usually talk with peers in the investment industry, or with customers, suppliers, management, etc.?**

I talk to everyone, but I'm more interested in talking to people who are actually running businesses, such as entrepreneurs, general managers, or excellent businesspeople. I read all the major news publications, as well as annual reports of leading companies. These materials also give me a lot of inspiration.

**Q: Are there any industries you would absolutely avoid?**

I don't ideologically exclude anything; I am against all ideologies. There are many things in the world I don't understand, but I am curious about many things. Sometimes I might only understand one aspect of a company well, but that very aspect could be the most important one for making an investment. I'm not sure; I don't want to rule out that possibility. However, one thing I am sure of is that if you show me an idea, I can quickly tell you whether I would say "no" to it.
Basically, Charlie Munger has only three attitudes towards any idea: yes, no, or too hard. Some ideas can be quickly discerned as yes or no, but if it's truly too hard, then walk away. Ultimately, you still have to focus your energy on those ideas you are willing to spend time and effort researching, and ensure you understand them better than anyone else.

**III. How to Evaluate Company Management**

**Q: How do you assess whether a company's management is honestly answering your questions? How useful are conversations with management?**

Regardless of whether the business itself is good or bad, management is always part of the success equation for a company, so the quality of management is always important. However, assessing the quality of management is not easy. If you cannot judge the quality of management, that in itself is a conclusion. You can consider this conclusion alongside other factors (such as the quality of the business, the company's valuation, etc.) as a basis for deciding whether to invest.
If you can correctly assess the quality of a management team, it means you are either very sharp, deeply versed in human psychology, or you have a special relationship with those people. If that's the case, you should certainly incorporate the quality of management into your decision-making process. It will improve the accuracy of your predictions because management is an important part of the company.
However, deeply and accurately assessing a management team is by no means easy; very few people can truly do it. So I also admire a type of person who has the courage to say, "No matter how much information I get, no matter how beautifully they present it, my understanding of the management stops here. I know it's a show, so I simply won't consider the management's influence at all." I greatly respect this attitude.
Investing requires intellectual honesty. You need to know what you know, and more importantly, you need to know what you don't know. If understanding the management team is not a card in your hand, then it shouldn't be factored into your consideration.

**IV. Do You Allocate Investments by Region?**

**Q: How do you allocate your investments between domestic (US) and international?**

I don't have any preconceived standards for regional allocation of investments; instead, I follow opportunities and interests. It just so happens that I am more interested in Asia and the US, so my investments are concentrated there. In comparison, I'm not as interested in Europe and Africa, but I still keep an open mind and pay attention to them. My goal is to find the best companies managed by the most excellent people and buy them when the best prices appear on the market, holding them for the long term. These conditions aren't always met simultaneously, but that's okay (you can wait patiently).
When you first start investing, you hold cash. The return on cash is a good opportunity cost because it doesn't result in loss of principal. When you find an investment opportunity, it must be able to improve the risk-adjusted return of the entire portfolio. Later, you might find several very interesting investment opportunities, so your portfolio consists of some interesting securities plus cash. This is also a good opportunity cost. The next time you add another security, it should ideally make your portfolio's (risk-adjusted return) better than it is now. This way, you can continuously optimize your opportunity cost. Portfolio construction is a process of continuously optimizing opportunity costs.

**V. How to Define Your Circle of Competence**

**Q: How do you define your circle of competence?**

I define my circle of competence based on my interests. Obviously, I have a certain degree of understanding of China, Asia, and the US; these are areas I am relatively familiar with. Over the years, I have been gradually expanding my horizons.
When I first started investing, I was just looking for cheap securities. Because back then, there weren't many other choices—no experience, and I didn't want to lose money. So what could I do? I could only buy the cheapest stocks. But over time, if you find that besides being interested in stocks, you are also interested in the businesses themselves, then naturally you will start studying businesses.
Then you begin to learn about and research different types of businesses. You learn about the DNA of businesses, how they evolve, why they are so powerful. Over time, I fell in love with those strong (high-quality) companies! So I switched to looking for high-quality companies at attractive prices. Of course, my natural inclination to seek cheap securities is still there.
But as time went on, finding those high-quality companies became more appealing to me. These companies are more competitive, easier to predict, and have strong management teams and good corporate cultures. Just investing in the secondary market was no longer satisfying for me. As I said before, part of the securities market is a zero-sum game. I can't resonate with that part. By nature, I'm more interested in win-win situations.
I want to create wealth together with the operators and employees of the companies I invest in. This drove me to start venture capital investments early in my fund's history. I try to follow the principles of smart investing, and it ultimately turned out that I could also contribute some of my own strength to the company's development, which created a win-win situation.
In my career, I have been fortunate to participate in founding several different startup companies. Some of them were very successful and continued to operate well even after we sold them. You might say we sold too early. I was the first investor in Capital IQ. If we hadn't sold, we might be much richer now! It's not that we didn't make money on this investment—we did (just not that much). I think this outcome is quite good. I like creating situations that benefit everyone: we created job opportunities, developed an excellent, sustainable product, and everyone benefited, including the people who eventually bought Capital IQ from us (S&P).
I like this kind of win-win situation. I never complained about selling Capital IQ too early; we made a lot of money on it, and we contributed greatly to its development. What makes me even happier is that to this day, the founder and I are still friends. However, the problem with venture capital is that it's difficult to scale; you have to put in a lot of effort. So gradually, I started to shift towards helping businesses in a different way. I found that you can also provide constructive help to those public companies. That's how I am—still constantly learning, full of curiosity about things. I'm still young and have strong curiosity. I hope to maintain this drive to learn and continue to expand my circle of competence.

**VI. About BYD**

**Q: Berkshire typically doesn't invest in tech companies. How did you get Charlie Munger to invest in BYD under these circumstances?**

I never thought Buffett and Munger were ideological in their investments. I'm not either. Investing in a company mainly depends on how well you understand it. The BYD story is simple. The company's founder is an extremely outstanding engineer. He started the company with just a $300,000 loan and had no other external investors until the IPO. He built a company with $8 billion in annual revenue, 170,000 employees, and tens of thousands of engineers (Note: 2013 data). In the process, he overcame all kinds of hardships and obstacles.
BYD's achievements are admirable. Of course, they also happened to have the right timing, location, and people—they were in the right industry and environment and received government support at the right time. The company's engineering culture gives BYD the ability to solve major problems. When we invested in BYD, we had a large margin of safety on the price.
They are applying their talents in a huge field full of possibilities and have a considerable chance of success. As I said, nothing is absolute, but in my view, in the industry BYD is in, its probability of success is extremely high. Mr. Munger was as impressed with the company as I was, so he ultimately decided to invest. It's not that Berkshire完全不投 (completely doesn't invest in) tech companies; they just don't invest in companies they don't understand. They once invested $11 billion in IBM. But I guarantee you, this had nothing to do with whether IBM is a tech company; that's not the basis of Berkshire's consideration.

**Q: Do you think BYD has made progress in car quality?**

BYD is like a continuous learning machine. Think about it: the company only officially entered the (automobile manufacturing) industry ten years ago and produced its first car eight years ago. In a market where they have to compete fiercely with all global brands, they have to go all out because the market is so huge. Moreover, they never had any so-called local competitive advantage because China's auto industry has been open to all international brands from the start.
Yet, this once humble car company, with meager capital and in less than ten years, achieved annual sales of 500,000 cars and earned a place in the market. It must be said that this result is quite good; this company has real capability. With their engineering culture and can-do spirit, they continuously prove their ability to solve complex engineering problems and always find more efficient, cost-effective, and optimized solutions than most others. This is an advantage in manufacturing.

**VII. Views on Investing in High-Tech Companies**

**Q: BYD is a high-tech company facing rapid changes. How do you view the returns and risks of investing in such companies? Do you think you can predict its development in ten years?**

If you invest long enough, the vast majority of companies will change. I've never heard of a business that remains unchanged forever. This is precisely the fascination of business. Successful businesses (companies) have certain qualities that allow them to cope more comfortably when changes occur. But each case is different.
In a sense, every company in this era is a tech company, except that some companies use technology that isn't the most cutting-edge, or technology isn't the most critical factor determining the success or failure of the business or the company.
Successful tech companies have the ability to constantly innovate, self-evolve, and respond to change. Intel is a great example. The industry Intel is in changes every 18 months. If you can't keep up with the pace of change, you are at a serious disadvantage, but they have built their unique culture amidst constant change.
Take Samsung as another example. Their early business was semiconductor memory chips, where prices dropped 1% every week. Yet, they developed a culture to precisely cope with this change. So when they applied this culture to other industries like mobile phones, they quickly surpassed others. Now Samsung's phone sales have exceeded Apple's. So corporate culture plays a very important role in rapidly changing business environments, allowing certain companies to stand out in competition.

**Q: To fully research the risks and returns of high-tech companies, does one need to understand the technology to the level of an engineer?**

(It's) certainly good if you understand the technology (when researching tech companies), but it's not necessary. If you happen to be an engineer familiar with the company's products, that's a plus, but it's not essential for researching the company. Because no matter how good you are at one thing, there are always other things you are not as good at. Technology changes rapidly; what you specialize in now will soon become obsolete, but this doesn't affect your ability to judge whether a company can build a culture to cope with change. Successful companies always find various ways to deal with change, such as recruiting talent, building an excellent corporate culture, staying one step ahead of competitors, etc. These are the factors that make a company successful and are also relatively easier to predict.
In any industry or business, there are always aspects that are unpredictable and aspects that are predictable. Both will exist. But overall, I think you are right (about high-tech companies). For a rapidly changing business, making reliable predictions is indeed more difficult, without a doubt. But this doesn't mean investors cannot make some predictions with high odds of success. You should only make a move when you feel your prediction accuracy is very high. Often, you need to look for businesses that are usually stable but have suddenly changed in some aspects.
Take Kodak as an example. It was once one of the best companies in the world, inventing the camera. But what about today? Look at Bell Labs and AT&T; they were once incredibly powerful, monopolizing the entire industry. And today? Little more than their names remain. This is the brutal nature of capitalism and the essence of business competition. Things that seem stable and predictable may not turn out that way. Conversely, things that seem unstable may ultimately succeed.

Compared to making a roughly correct decision, I think it is equally important, if not more important, to avoid making wrong decisions. If you can avoid mistakes as much as possible, you should do well in the long run. Prediction is not easy, nor is it as precise as science. You can only hope to improve over time.

**Q: Many smart people believe renewable energy is the next great revolution. You have done a lot of research on battery technology and BYD. Besides batteries, what insights do you have in this field? How do you think the energy revolution will develop?**

I pay attention to macro trends and only want to understand whether these major trends are tailwinds or headwinds for me. As a citizen concerned about current affairs, I care about the macroeconomy, and...
