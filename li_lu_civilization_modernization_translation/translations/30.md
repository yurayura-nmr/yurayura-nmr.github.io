Praise from others loses its meaning if one is not truly independent. Others are different; they are happy every day just looking at their own bag, as long as they like it themselves. Independent individuals are often unaffected by others' evaluations; this is an innate trait. And this quality of independence is particularly important for investors, because investors face all kinds of temptations at all times and often generate envy due to comparison.

Secondly, this person must indeed be able to be relatively objective and less influenced by emotions. Of course, everyone is an emotional creature and cannot completely escape the influence of feelings, but there are indeed some people who can practice the pursuit of objectivity and rationality as a value and moral concept. Such people are more suitable for value investing. Investment actually involves objectively analyzing various problems and also judging things far into the future, which is itself very difficult. If we look not from the perspective of a company's balance sheet but discuss its profitability, then competition is the most important. A company with good returns will inevitably attract a large number of competitors who will seize market share and profits, so predicting whether a currently successful company can maintain high profits 10 years later is very difficult. Even the company's managers may not be able to tell clearly, often being "unable to see the forest for the trees." Therefore, you must maintain a very objective and rational attitude and be able to continuously learn, which is extremely important.

The next quality is also quite special: this person must be both extremely patient and very decisive—a contradiction. When there are no opportunities, they can do nothing for many, many years, but once an opportunity comes, they suddenly become very decisive and can place heavy bets without hesitation. I have been an investment partner with Mr. Munger for sixteen or seventeen years. We have dinner together at least once a week, so I know him quite well. Here, I can tell a story about his investment. Mr. Munger subscribes to Barron's, a weekly magazine related to the stock market from the American Wall Street Journal. He has been reading this magazine for nearly forty or fifty years. Of course, the main purpose is to find investment opportunities. So, in those forty or fifty years, how many opportunities did he find? One! Just one, and this opportunity was discovered after more than 30 years of reading. Then, for the next 10 years, he found no second opportunity. But this does not affect his continuous reading; I know he still reads every issue. He has extreme patience and can do nothing, but when he really discovers this opportunity, he dares to bet heavily with everything, and this investment earned him a lot. This is an essential quality of an excellent investor: you must have extreme patience, just studying diligently when opportunities haven't come, but when opportunities arrive, you must have strong determination and the ability to act.

Fourthly, the reason why Mr. Munger can do this continuously for forty or fifty years is that he has an extremely strong interest in business. Warren and Charlie always talk about money sense. Money sense is a strong interest in business and a natural liking for pondering: how does this business make money? Why does it make money? What will the competitive state be like in the future? Can it still make money in the future? These people always want to thoroughly understand these questions. This interest is actually their main motivation.

These traits are not particularly natural, but together, they can make you a very excellent investor. Some of these traits are innate, and some are acquired. For example, interest in business can actually be cultivated slowly. But some traits, such as extreme independence, extreme patience, and extreme decisiveness, may not be cultivatable. Ordinary people, after looking at something for over 30 years and finding nothing, would have stopped long ago. And after discovering this one opportunity, they always want to immediately find another. But Mr. Munger did not. Because I am close to him, I observe very clearly that his character is indeed like this. Independence is also not particularly easy to achieve because the vast majority of people are influenced by social evaluations and care about others' opinions. Such people find it difficult to persist on the path of value investing.

In comparison, IQ and education are really not very important. If IQ and education were important, then Newton would be the stock god. In fact, Newton invested all his savings in the South Sea Company's stock during the peak of the bubble and almost lost everything. So even if you think you are more talented than Newton, it is actually useless. You absolutely do not need such a high IQ, do not need to be so smart, and certainly do not need to be a genius. Anyway, I am definitely not smarter than Newton. The investment industry really does not require particularly high IQ or too many prestigious educations and experiences. I have seen too many smart, highly educated, and experienced investors who ended up very unsuccessful and were easily attracted to speculation. Of course, they can say they use fundamental analysis methods plus understanding of the market, etc. Anyway, they can talk a good game. The smarter the person, the more glibly they talk, and the worse the outcome. You do not need to be professionally trained or have an MBA, but you must have a strong interest in business. If you本身 (yourself) do not have a strong interest in business, even an MBA may not necessarily cultivate it.

A friend of mine who is very successful in investment told me that investment is very much like playing golf, and I agree. You must maintain a calm mind. If your mood gets slightly excited, you will definitely play poorly. The previous shot has no relation to the next shot; each shot is independent. Even if you made a birdie (note: golf term, one stroke under par, a very good score) on the previous shot, the next shot may not necessarily be good. Moreover, each shot requires considering risk and return. The outcome of one hole does not determine the whole game; it is not the result until you retire. The record you leave behind is the truest achievement of your life. The longer the time, the harder it is. So playing more golf helps cultivate the character of an investor. Meditation is also very beneficial; it can help you recognize your blind spots more clearly. For example, playing bridge can cultivate your patience, etc. Some things can help you improve in these aspects, especially the acquired components of these traits I mentioned. Like golf, if you do not practice or implement certain things for a period of time, you will indeed forget. Once you detach from business, your sharpness will indeed slowly disappear.

If some people say they indeed do not possess these traits, what should they do? My suggestion is not to force yourself to do things you are not good at. You can find people with these traits who are good at it to help you. People always need to find things they are relatively good at and like to do, so they can be happy and motivated because they are not doing it for others.

## V. How Ordinary People Can Protect and Increase Their Wealth

Next, let's talk about how an ordinary investor, who may not want to be a professional investor or may not have the opportunity, can protect their property and let it slowly increase.

First, don’t forget that your alternative is cash. Cash can also be the result of fundamental research and analysis. When you haven’t found a better opportunity cost, cash is a good choice, certainly better than spending money recklessly on speculation.

Second, if a market's equities can roughly reflect the overall condition of the economy, then index investing is still very useful. If the economy itself grows at an actual rate of about 2-3%, plus inflation, that is a nominal growth of about 4-5%, then the average profit of large companies in the economy will be slightly higher, say 6-7% growth. As we mentioned earlier, if it grows at this rate for more than 200 years, it is a million-fold return. Even within your lifetime, over 30 or 40 years, it will bring you quite good returns. So don’t believe those who casually talk about returns of tens of percent per year or double returns; most of these are speculators. Investment must be reliable. What is reliable? Sustainable things. If it is not sustainable, don’t listen. So index investing, when the index can roughly reflect the average performance of the entire economy, is a good choice.

If you can find excellent investors, that is of course best, but finding excellent investors is not particularly easy, especially in the current domestic environment. We actually really want to build a small village of value investing like Graham and Doddsville in China, where some natives live, willing to share their relatively true return rates and how they achieved such returns, to see if there are long-term results. Now there are many investors who casually call the funds they manage "products." I find this term hard to understand; it feels like something produced in a factory, and there are often dozens of them, as if without one or two hundred products, you can’t be called a successful investor. But in the end, you simply cannot figure out what their investment results are. For 23 years, I have managed only one fund, and my money is basically invested in it, so it is relatively easier to judge the investment results. If you can find an investor worthy of entrustment, who is truly using the correct methods, this is of course a very good choice.

Generally speaking, when choosing an investor, you must first see clearly whether they are a speculator. Second, they must possess certain investor qualities. Third, they must have a certain depth of understanding of their profession and a relatively long record of investment return performance. Next, you need to see if their chosen circle of competence is in a highly competitive circle. If their circle of competence happens to be in a less competitive range, it is more likely to achieve better returns. Also, you need to see if their fee structure is reasonable and win-win, and if their interests have major conflicts with investors. The last point is that this person is not too old and can still let your wealth grow compoundly for a considerable time. If you can find an investor who meets all these conditions, you can say you are very lucky.

But overall, the biggest taboo for individual investors is being tempted by the market, like Newton, entering when the market is very hot and exiting when the market is depressed. Not participating in speculation is the most basic principle. As long as you do this and only invest in things you understand, not doing things you don’t understand, you basically will not lose money. Some people aspire to do investment themselves, which is also good, but because individual investors have relatively limited time, investment must be relatively concentrated. You must invest in a few stocks that you really particularly understand. This concentration is very important. Because the time, energy, experience, etc., of individual investors are concentrated in very few areas, within these areas, you can only be concentrated; you must be concentrated. Through long-term efforts, individual investors can also achieve this level. But the biggest taboo is paying information exploitation tax. Look at the fund manager's fee mechanism. If it is not a win-win fee mechanism, do not consider it. Any mechanism that only benefits the manager definitely has problems.

So, if you understand these basic principles, you can protect your wealth and also let your wealth grow slowly. As long as it grows in a compound, correct way, even if it grows slowly, the long-term return is considerable. Most people have no belief in compound interest because the phenomenon of compound interest is not common in life. For example, what is most likely to grow compoundly is various experiences and wisdom. But because most people's learning methods have problems, their knowledge cannot accumulate and often becomes outdated. Therefore, they do not even see the most basic knowledge compound interest phenomenon and find it hard to imagine how powerful compound interest is. If you are interested in investment, you must understand the magic of compound interest. Einstein called it the eighth wonder of the world, which is absolutely justified. The more you understand the power of compound interest and the difficulty of obtaining compound interest, then when you get the opportunity for compound growth, even if it doesn’t look particularly impressive, such as an opportunity of six, seven, eight, or nine percent, you must understand that this is the most important opportunity of your life and you must seize it. As long as the time for compound interest is long enough, this is the best and most important opportunity of your life. The above points are my suggestions for ordinary people.

## VI. Value Investing and Life

Finally, let’s summarize value investing. Is value investing a belief? I think it might be because it indeed reflects a value—you are unwilling to exploit others, unwilling to play zero-sum games, only willing to make money while also benefiting society. You are unwilling to be a person who relies entirely on gambling to make money. So next time when you see a speculator, you don’t need to say "Good luck!" to them because they cannot always be lucky. You should say "Have a good time!" When everyone goes to the casino to play, they are actually buying happiness. If you spend money and can’t even have fun, then the money is wasted. Many people come back feeling very low and depressed, then the trip was in vain. What is even scarier is becoming a gambler and ending up losing everything. If you just go to the casino for a play, that is acceptable. But if your values are not those of a gambler, then you must stay away from gambling in the stock market and absolutely not do things you don’t understand. Things you understand are things that you can predict correctly with extremely high probability over a considerable period of time. If this condition is not met, you would rather not touch it. So from this perspective, value investing indeed reflects a value and can be said to be a belief.

If it is a belief, it must be verified, and in the process, you must also experience the test of despair, so your emotions will definitely fluctuate, at least at the beginning. But slowly, you will truly make it a part of your life, and the ups and downs gradually become undisturbed by honor or disgrace. Led by your strong interest in business itself, you slowly build your own circle of competence, then move with ease within your circle of competence, and afterwards, you can focus without distraction, staying away from interference from other noise. So I find that most truly successful investors are relatively far from financial centers, and the farther away, the better the performance, such as Omaha. Actually, communicating less with people in financial centers like Beijing, Shanghai, New York, and Hong Kong may be more helpful. Those seemingly "high-end" trading theories are actually noise. Why call it noise? Because the net result of speculation is zero. If you only remember one thing from my sharing today, just remember this zero-sum concept—the net result of speculation is zero. Although people don’t mention it, the fact is就是这样 (like this); it is a very simple mathematical concept. Remember this, and next time you encounter those "high-end" statements, you can treat them as Mr. Market.
