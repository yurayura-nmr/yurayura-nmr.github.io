**Section 2 of 60**

...was the Chinese preface he wrote for the *Encyclopedia*. After the gathering, a few friends stayed behind to listen to Li Lu discuss human evolution and the China issue. This was the first time I heard him use the principles of evolutionary theory to explain the formation of culture. I was particularly impressed by a discussion between Li Lu and Ma Qingyun, who was then the Dean of the School of Architecture at the University of Southern California, on a question related to architectural design. Li Lu very persuasively used the influence of geography on human evolution to explain the reasons for using trees and lawns in architectural design.

For nearly two years after that, when we took walks and chatted in the gardens of the Pasadena city government, what he talked about most was how to view various issues, including investing in China, from an evolutionary perspective. He explained to me in detail the influence of four books on him: *Guns, Germs, and Steel* by UCLA Professor Jared M. Diamond, *Why the West Rules—for Now* by Stanford Professor Ian Morris, *The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves* by British science writer Matt Ridley, and *The Social Conquest of Earth* by biologist and anthropologist E. O. Wilson. He also shared his own major discoveries while researching China's issues, particularly regarding why modernization did not occur in China and how China would develop in the future. He had already formed a unique and complete theoretical system on these questions.

At first, I was quite skeptical, but later I agreed more often, and in the end, I was completely convinced. I encouraged him to write a book about these ideas to share his thoughts with more people. Initially, he was very hesitant. Later, on several different occasions with friends, he shared his latest understanding of the history of human civilization and modernization, which was refreshing and enlightening for everyone. One day in August 2012, I took a voice recorder and asked him to explain his theory on the history of human civilization and modernization from beginning to end. I had someone transcribe it, formally starting the work of compiling the text for *Li Lu on Modernization*.

For nearly eight months thereafter, Li Lu dictated, and my colleagues from Himalaya and I worked on the transcription. The transcribed text was then personally revised and corrected by Li Lu. In early April 2013, we finally completed the first version of *Li Lu on Modernization*, coincidentally on his 47th birthday.

After completion, we sent this nearly 50,000-word long article to friends to circulate among themselves. It received an enthusiastic response. Some friends in China even had the article printed into a booklet as a gift for their own friends. Li Min, the founder of Huxiu.com, contacted Li Lu after reading the long article, hoping to publish it first on Huxiu.com. After further revision and editing by Li Lu, it was officially published in May 2014 as a series titled *Li Lu on Modernization* on Huxiu.com, divided into 16 parts, with one part published weekly. It was also published on Li Lu's personal Weibo. After publication, each article was widely shared online and sparked lively discussions, becoming the most popular series on Huxiu.com that year.

The first part of this book, "Civilization, Modernization, and China," includes the 16 articles from the *Li Lu on Modernization* series. *Li Lu on Modernization* applies the scientific methodology and research findings of New History, combined with over 30 years of Li Lu's personal thinking, interpretation, and argumentation, to propose many original viewpoints and theories on the development of human civilization, especially the birth and development of modernization. On this basis, it puts forward his explorations and predictions regarding China's future, the impact of China's modernization on the West, and the common destiny of humanity. During his process of thinking and writing, I had the privilege of being his first reader and engaging in deep exchanges and intellectual stimulation with him directly. I gained a relatively deep understanding and comprehension of his ideological system. I also shared some fragmented feelings and insights about the *Li Lu on Modernization* series with friends through Weibo and WeChat. I also noticed that because Li Lu uses condensed and refined language and a new ideological framework that breaks through traditional thinking patterns to re-analyze the tens of thousands of years of human civilization history starting from the exodus from Africa, and discusses many major historical topics related to human civilization and Chinese social development, some readers feel at a loss. As the vast amount of historical data cited and the fields of knowledge covered far exceed my own knowledge scope, I also found reading it quite challenging and had to hastily brush up on many key areas of knowledge.

To help readers better understand Li Lu's exposition on the process of human civilization and the theoretical system of modernization, I have compiled those fragmented reading impressions I previously published online, adding some new understandings and insights gained from my conversations with the author. In my opinion, Li Lu's new understanding and knowledge of human civilization history and Chinese history represent the most profound intellectual exploration of the world's and China's past and future by our generation (those born in the 1960s). Particularly, Li Lu's understanding of the essence and iron law of modernization is an intellectual leap that will have epoch-making significance! Understanding the essence and iron law of modernization allows one to understand why the trend of globalization is unstoppable, and also to understand why China will continue to develop over the next few decades into a truly world power.

First, Li Lu has broken through the macro-analysis method of "Big History" scholars in his methodology for studying historical phenomena. Li Lu adopted the Social Development Index created by Professor Ian Morris to observe and study history quantitatively. Simultaneously, he utilized the latest research findings from multiple social and natural science fields such as history, archaeology, geography, climate, astronomy, biology, genetics, economics, and sociology, employing a scientific and rational way of thinking to delve deeply into the essence and developmental laws of historical phenomena. This allows for reasonable and reliable explanations of historical events in the process of human civilization development and reasonable and reliable predictions of future possible events. Morris's Social Development Index is composed of specific parameters related to four aspects of human capability: energy capture, social organization, information technology, and war-making capacity. These parameters can be extracted scientifically from different stages of human history and charted, allowing us to see the trajectory of human civilization development, especially the trajectories and comparisons of the Eastern and Western civilizational centers.

Li Lu believes that human evolution has a dual nature—biological evolution and cultural evolution. Darwin's theory of evolution explains the process of biological evolution. But human evolution differs from biological evolution; it is the dual result of biological and cultural evolution. Cultural evolution is carried out by humans through forms such as writing, religion, and art, and through the accumulation of learning and knowledge over generations. Its speed of inheritance and development is far faster than biological inheritance, thus widening the distance between humans and other species. This distance between humans and animals is defined as civilization in this book.

Building on Morris's Human Social Development Index, Li Lu proposes dividing human civilization into three stages: 1.0 Hunter-Gatherer Civilization, 2.0 Agricultural/Pastoral Civilization, and 3.0 Scientific and Technological Civilization. This classification differs from the traditional classifications based on social development forms or institutional evolution that we are familiar with. It is not directly linked to culture or social systems but is entirely differentiated based on the different stages of growth of the Morris Index curve, reflecting the growth pattern of the Morris Index curve. From the perspective of the Morris Index, human civilization underwent a huge leap forward around 70,000 years ago when humans left Africa and spread across the globe over the following tens of thousands of years. During this process, our ancestors demonstrated wisdom, imagination, creativity, and enterprise completely absent in other animals. Although their lifestyle did not change drastically compared to their time in Africa, remaining in a primitive state of hunting and gathering, the population grew rapidly and covered the globe, significantly reducing the risk of extinction and laying the foundation for the next civilizational leap.

Li Lu believes that the birth of agricultural civilization around 9600 BC was a gift brought to humanity by global warming. On this point, Li Lu adopts the research of Jared Diamond, believing that the centers of agricultural civilization first appeared in the so-called Lucky Latitudes belt: in the West, in the Hilly Flanks of Southwest Asia, and in China, appearing two thousand years later in the Yellow and Yangtze River basins. The Americas and Australia, due to geographical isolation, essentially had no agriculture. The two major Eastern and Western civilizational centers gradually formed from the birth of agricultural civilization. Li Lu argues that after three attempts at reaching a peak by Eastern and Western agricultural civilizations, by AD 1776, three events—Adam Smith publishing *The Wealth of Nations* in Britain, the American Founding Fathers issuing the Declaration of Independence, and James Watt announcing the manufacture of the world's first steam engine in Birmingham—marked the leap of human civilization to the 3.0 stage. Here, Li Lu does not call the 3.0 civilization "Industrial Civilization" as is customary, but names it "Scientific and Technological Civilization." This is not for the sake of being different but carries profound meaning—it reflects Li Lu's deep understanding of the concept of modernization.

To elaborate on the process and mechanisms of human civilization's evolution from 1.0 to 3.0, Li Lu, from the third lecture to the tenth, uses eight installments to review history. Spanning from the origins of human civilization 70,000 years ago to the spread of modernization in the 19th century and the debate over the path of modernization in the 20th century, the discussion involves and encompasses major issues such as Earth's climate change, the emergence of intelligent hominid ancestors, the fundamental physiological and intellectual differences between humans and animals, the ceiling of agricultural civilization, why the scientific revolution occurred in Europe, how modernization was born, and why modernization did not originate in China.

The eleventh lecture—"The Essence and Iron Law of Modernization"—is the most profound and originally thought-provoking piece in Li Lu's sixteen-part series on modernization. "Modernization" has been a rather泛滥 (widely used/connotatively 'overused' or 'vague') concept in both East and West, with countless scholars and philosophers offering deep thoughts, research, and discourses on what constitutes modernization. The relatively widely accepted understanding now is that modernization is a process of transformation from a traditional agricultural society to an industrial society. But various questions surrounding this concept—such as what is the core driving force of this transformation? Is it unidirectional or bidirectional? Is it singular or are there alternatives? Is it active or passive? Is it constructive or destructive?—remain controversial to this day. In recent decades, due to the spread and popularization of green environmentalist ideas in Western societies, an anti-modernization trend has even emerged, pursuing a return to tradition, to primitive, to an agricultural-era lifestyle without modern technology. The reason for this is that people's understanding of modernization still remains at the level of industrialization, and they have not yet grasped the essence of modernization.

In the second lecture of the first part, "The Trajectory of Civilization," Li Lu applies Ian Morris's research on the Human Social Development Index to explore the development process of human civilization. From Morris's charts of Eastern and Western social development indices, it can be seen that after AD 1800, the West took the lead in entering a period of rapid development, and the East also began to take off from the 20th century onwards. Both Eastern and Western societies showed rocket-like development, with the Social Development Index exhibiting sustained compound growth. He calls the civilization of this period 3.0 Civilization, and terms it Scientific and Technological Civilization.

Why does Li Lu call human civilization after 1800 "Scientific and Technological Civilization" rather than the conventionally understood "Industrial Civilization"?

In the eighth lecture of the first part, "The Birth of Modernization," he astutely observes that three unrelated events occurring in the same year, 1776—the publication of Adam Smith's *The Wealth of Nations*, the issuance of the American Declaration of Independence, and the invention of the Watt steam engine—became a watershed in human civilization history. Thereafter, the modernization process of human society became unstoppable, spreading from Britain across the globe. These three events represent free market economy, limited government under constitutional democracy, and modern science and technology, respectively. Throughout the period from the Industrial Revolution to the present, the most successful and developed countries globally all possess these three key elements.

He calls the combination of modern science and technology with the free market the greatest institutional innovation in human history. He points out that human nature emotionally pursues equality of outcome, but rationally pursues equality of opportunity; the pursuit of equality of outcome ensures that any progress of human civilization will ultimately spread to every corner of the Earth; societies that establish systems providing equality of opportunity will prosper, progress, and enjoy long-term stability. The free market economy provides everyone with genuine equal opportunity, allowing all people the possibility to realize their talents and obtain their deserved economic fruits. He calls this system "Economic Meritocracy." In such a system, the combination of modern technology and the free market economy allows scientific and technological knowledge to be rapidly transformed into new productive forces, abstract ideas quickly turned into products, and these products rapidly produced by the lowest-cost means and supplied to every consumer through the free market mechanism, creating wealth. The limited government under constitutional democracy provides protection for citizens' individual rights, freedoms, and private property, provides the necessary freedom for technological innovation, offers basic guarantees for the free market economy to operate according to rules, and allows social wealth to be distributed through the fair competition of the free market mechanism under the principle of equality of opportunity. Therefore, in Li Lu's view, the seamless combination of modern technology and the free market economy is the most core, essential, and successful social form of 3.0 Civilization.

Building on this, Li Lu very insightfully points out: "The essence of modernization is the combination of modern science and technology with the free market economy, which enables the human economy to enter a state of sustainable compound growth. Societies and nations that enter this state are modernized societies and nations."

Why can the combination of modern science and technology with the free market economy enable the human economy to enter a state of sustainable compound growth? Li Lu uses the concept of comparative advantage by the classical economics master, British political economist David Ricardo, to explain: two individuals with different capabilities, if they each focus on their specialties, the total value they create after exchanging with each other is actually greater. This can be represented by the mathematical formula 1+1>2. The more people involved in exchange, the larger the market, and the more incremental value is created. Li Lu further points out that this shows the free market itself is an economy of scale.

The conclusion that "the free market economy can create more social wealth" is, today, no longer a remarkable insight. The founder of modern economics, Adam Smith, had already systematically unraveled the secret that social division of labor plus free exchange can create more social wealth in his *The Wealth of Nations*. And David Ricardo, in his *Principles of Political Economy...*
