...will remain correct for a very long time. Let me emphasize again, you might only encounter a few such opportunities in your lifetime. If you are confident you can see clearly ten years ahead, that's already excellent. Those working in investment banks think they can predict the endless future – do you think that's possible? It's simply a fantasy! Everyone knows they can't even predict tomorrow, so how could they predict the next 5 or 10 years? Or even forever? What they do is meaningless. But I guarantee, if you have decent talent, the right temperament, plus diligence, and spend a lifetime learning, perhaps in your fifty-year investment career you can find 5-10 opportunities. In these opportunities, you have your own unique insight and can foresee the next ten or twenty years more accurately than others. By that time, you won't even think about selling. What reason is there to sell? The government lends you money interest-free and won't ask for it back. The company's annual Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is as high as 40-100%. This is a very tax-efficient allocation, so you wouldn't sell.

**Student:** Then why did you sell Timberland?

Because it didn't have these characteristics; it wasn't among the exceptional companies. There are some companies in my current portfolio that are in this category, but I won't discuss them.

**Bruce:** Can you summarize the common characteristics of these exceptional companies?

The competitive advantages of these companies (regardless of how they built their advantages) will keep strengthening, strengthening, and strengthening again. Everyone can try to find some examples. You spent so much money to attend business school; you must build your own mental framework, at least develop a habit of how to think about these issues. What is the reason one company is so much better than its peers? Where is the competitive advantage? Why do they earn more and more money? Why do other companies earn less and less or experience fluctuations? What are the reasons? You need to study companies that have already established advantages to develop your own judgment. (A student mentions Philip Morris) What is the essential reason that distinguishes Philip Morris from other brands? (Student replies the brand was established early) That's a good factor, but not my favorite factor. (A student says Coca-Cola, which built a connection between its brand and happiness; Li Lu shakes his head; Ebay, Li Lu says is a good example; another student mentions a truck company, etc.)

**Bruce:** Do you agree with these or not?

They are basically reciting Buffett's holdings; I can't disagree. But I hope everyone can name some that Buffett hasn't bought yet, some companies you think might have potential. I don't want you to just pick examples from the classic cases of already legendary investors. Can you give me the name of a company they haven't bought but also has these characteristics, not in Berkshire's portfolio? (Another student says Ebay again; Li Lu says good. Another student mentions communication towers; Li Lu then asks why all wireless communication tower companies went bankrupt?) One of the three stocks I bought when I was studying was American Tower. (Students mention many other companies) How come no one mentions the companies you use every day in your research? (A student mentions Value Line) Good. (Someone says computers) Are you sure computers can make money? (A student mentions Capital IQ) Very good. Let's talk about Bloomberg. Before Bloomberg, there were Bridge and Reuters. Why did Bloomberg ultimately win? (Students give many reasons, but finally a student mentions high switching costs, unwilling to learn another system after learning Bloomberg) I use this example because you will find that almost every industry faces similar changes; this case analysis can be applied by analogy. Once you thoroughly research one example, you can make relatively accurate judgments about similar situations in other industries. Bloomberg's story is typical: an unknown company emerged, even though many established predecessors were in the industry, it moved forward bit by bit, reached a milestone qualitative change at a certain point, and finally became the industry monopolist. Where do you find Bridge and Reuters now? They are gone. As this student just said, you spent a long time learning this difficult-to-learn but essential daily tool (Bloomberg), so you are unwilling to spend time learning another tool. Plus, your colleagues and peers also use Bloomberg; you need to communicate with them. So in this field, the winner takes all. How to reach this conclusion is what's truly interesting. Suppose you had the chance to observe the industry's early development, and suppose you indeed observed the point of qualitative change for Bloomberg – perhaps after they promoted their platform to all business schools, so you graduates would only use Bloomberg and be unwilling to learn others. Suppose Bloomberg went public, and you had this insight, then you'd be sitting on a gold mine.

This is what I call insight. You will continually discover companies like Bloomberg; this phenomenon happens in many industries. Think about why Microsoft overtook Apple. Apple was once the industry leader, holding almost 100% of the market, but Microsoft gradually eroded it and finally crossed that threshold. When faced with choosing between Microsoft and Apple, you find you actually have no choice but to use Microsoft because company computer systems were all Microsoft. Now you don't even have the opportunity *not* to use Bloomberg. Does Bloomberg have any cost? No, the cost is almost zero! Most of their cost goes to paying their employees high salaries. What do they need to do? Do they do research? They hardly do any research. They just visit your company periodically (every month), ask about your needs, what you use daily in your work. If you are a trader, one of the 95% of investors, you develop an almost superstitious fervor for those numbers. Bloomberg specifically developed a system for these people. Do you know how many formulas Bloomberg has? Tens of thousands! Does Bloomberg give you a manual? Of course not! They want to bind you one-on-one! Give you a bunch of formulas, then charge you hundreds of thousands. Because you use it every day, and in this industry, it seems every win or loss is counted in millions, so you don't care about the 300,000 annual fee. Even if Bloomberg asked for a few percentage points commission, you might have no choice. They will keep coming to you because you are a trader; you want new news and new functions every day. They constantly give you new functions, which is essentially putting shackles on you, binding you tighter and tighter to the point of despair. They absolutely will not provide you with a manual, nor let you know their costs; it's truly a money-printing machine. It binds each of you tightly with a product that costs almost nothing, and pays suppliers a pittance – because suppliers also have no choice. You users are bound by it, and willingly provide feedback and help it improve. They don't need to do research; they just ask you what you need. The user's cost of switching products is so high that other new products are completely no match. Hundreds of thousands of practitioners are held hostage by it, and it's a one-on-one hostage situation. How can other products compete? Now suppose you understand these situations very well, Bloomberg goes public, and you also observed the point of Bloomberg's qualitative change, would you invest in Bloomberg? I would. This is what I call insight. You study all businesses; they inevitably have ups and downs, but Bloomberg's predictability is very high. Other industries also have some degree of this predictability. As an analyst, an investor, a value investor, a business owner, your job is to persistently study these businesses, observe their trends, then perhaps in your lifetime you can discover a few similar opportunities. This is a practical and feasible method. I like Bloomberg. If Bloomberg were to sell shares – actually, it doesn't need to IPO for financing, why would it need financing? Even if it IPOs, it would have a high premium, P/E consistently high at 30x, and I wouldn't sell it because of short-term high prices. This is the evolution of my own philosophy, from the previous "sell if unwilling to buy" to now, holding some companies long-term. If you can truly find such companies, you have no need to sell. Any other questions?

**Student:** After investing, do you directly get involved in the company's operations and management?

It depends. I've done a lot of early venture capital, and have served as chairman of the board for two companies and as a board member for many companies, including Capital IQ which you mentioned. I was the first institutional investor in Capital IQ, when there was only the founder. We invested in Capital IQ to emulate Bloomberg's business model. In the case of Capital IQ, I was very involved. Initially, I was the largest external shareholder, extremely busy every day – you have to know I didn't even have a secretary to answer my phone. I handled everything personally, but unfortunately, I was stretched too thin. Later, the company was sold to S&P. After that, I invested in a data software company in the engineering field, hoping to transfer the Bloomberg experience to the engineering field. The result was also good; any high-skill field needs this kind of software. The insight you gain in one field can be borrowed for other fields.

But overall, I am a very curious person, wanting to investigate everything clearly, and very willing to become friends with company management. For example, the boss of Timberland became an investor in my fund after I sold his company's stock. This kind of relationship with entrepreneurs is what I want. I think you need to have this spirit of bold尝试 (trying boldly) and fearlessness. Only by truly immersing yourself in the company's daily operations can you observe the characteristics of industry development and the points of qualitative change from every decision the company makes. Nothing remains unchanged; this is what makes investing interesting. So we must keep learning. For example, with Bloomberg, maybe years later the situation will change. Although I don't know what specific reason might cause a drastic change, it's entirely possible. I have observed examples in other industries, like Microsoft; its situation has changed. The rise of free software might completely rewrite the industry's rules. Any industry and company will change. This is a good thing because those with active minds, always prepared, once they gain insight, will act at the right time. They will create enormous wealth from these changes.

1.  The "Value Investing Practicum" course at Columbia University was originally offered by Benjamin Graham. Warren Buffett is probably the most famous student of this course. After Graham retired, the course was suspended for many years until the early 1990s when Professor Bruce Greenwald revived it. Besides lectures by the professor, the course mainly invites over a dozen value investors to teach directly with examples. Mr. Buffett has always taught one of the middle sessions. Since the early 2000s, I have been honored to be invited to give a lecture in this course almost every year for over a decade. Unfortunately, most of the lecture content was not recorded. The 2006 session was one of the few lectures recorded on video by students. Mr. Jiang Zhigang, a domestic value investing enthusiast, kindly translated it and spread it online. Here I have made minor corrections and included it in this book. Because the article's content is a complete and truthful record of the teaching process, including live interaction and Q&A with students, please excuse any less carefully considered wording in the text.

**Investment is a Process of Discovering Yourself**

**-- Edited excerpt from a March 2013 interview by Columbia Business School's Graham & Doddsville magazine**

**I. On How to Excel at Investment**

**Q: How does the development of your investment style differ from Buffett's?**

An important part of the investment game is being yourself. Because investment always has some element of a "zero-sum game," you must find a way that suits your personality in this process and gain an advantage through long-term effort. When you buy, someone must be selling; vice versa. One of the two must have made a wrong decision. You must be sure you know more than your counterparty and can predict more accurately. This is a fiercely competitive game; you will encounter many people who are both smart and hardworking.

The only way to gain an advantage in this competitive investment game is to work persistently and hard on the right path. If you are doing what you love, you will naturally do it, even when relaxing, for example, while walking in the park, you are constantly thinking about it. If you find a method that suits you and persist with it, reaching this state of natural, spontaneous learning and thinking, over time you will accumulate a huge advantage. Investment is actually a process of discovering yourself: who I am, what my interests are, what I am good at, what I like to do, and then continuously strengthening and amplifying these advantages until you surpass others and achieve a considerable advantage. Charlie Munger often says: "I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don't know the other side's argument better than they do." Charlie is so right!

Investment is about predicting the future, yet the future is inherently unpredictable, so prediction is about probability. Therefore, the only way you can do better than others is to master all the facts as much as possible and truly know what you know and know what you don't know. This is your probability advantage. Nothing is 100% certain, but if you have an overwhelming advantage every time you swing (make a move), then over time, you can do very well.

**II. How to Get Investment Ideas**

**Q: Can you talk about your investment process?**

My ideas come from all aspects of life, mainly from reading and conversations. I don't care how they come, as long as they are good ideas. You can find good ideas through extensive reading, studying many companies, or learning from smart people – preferably smarter than you, especially those outstanding in their respective fields. I read as widely as possible, study all the great companies I'm interested in, and talk to many smart people. And then guess what, sometimes in some reading or conversation, a spark of insight appears, followed by further research. Sometimes you become more convinced, other times the opposite happens.
