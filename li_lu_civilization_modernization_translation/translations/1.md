**Charlie Munger on Li Lu**  

—By Charlie Munger  
Why is Li Lu so successful? I think part of the reason is that he is, so to speak, the Warren Buffett of China. That helps a lot. Another reason is that he is “fishing” in the Chinese market, not in the fiercely competitive U.S. market—which is overfished with too many fishermen. There are still some blind spots of ignorance and cognitive inertia in the Chinese market, which creates unusual opportunities for him. The first rule of fishing: “Go where the fish are.” The second rule of fishing: “Don’t forget the first rule.” Li Lu happens to be fishing where there are plenty of fish. The rest of us are like cod fishermen trying to find cod in overfished waters. When competition is too intense, no matter how hard you work, it won’t help.  

Q: What do you see in Li Lu that sets him apart from other Chinese investors? From his biography, he seems more like an outsider. How is he similar to or different from Todd Combs and Ted Weschler (investment officers at Berkshire Hathaway)? Why did you do that interview with Li Lu for Chinese media last year?  

I did the interview because Li Lu asked me to. Sometimes I do such things; in this regard, I am a bit “foolish.” In the interview, I just answered the questions truthfully, saying what I really thought. The answer is that Li Lu is no ordinary person; he is the Warren Buffett of China. He is very talented. Of course, I also enjoy criticizing him, but that’s part of the fun in our relationship. I am 95 years old this year. In 95 years, I have only once handed over the Munger family’s assets to an outsider to manage. And the result? Needless to say, it’s Li Lu—he hit a home run. This is incredible and extremely rare. From now on, with Li Lu as a precedent, would I choose anyone else? By the way, this is a good way to make decisions, and we do the same in our work. If we find something that allows us to achieve great things, we don’t need to look at anything inferior. This greatly simplifies life because there are very few people better than Li Lu. So I just need to sit quietly and wait. Spending time sitting quietly and waiting—this seemingly inactive approach is full of wisdom. In contrast, many people are too active.  

Q: Many people ask you how you decide what investments or trades to make, and your answer is that it’s a relatively quick process. My question is, how do you judge whether a fund manager or a company’s management has excellent character and integrity? How long does it take you to make that judgment? What qualities do you look for in them?  

Now that I’ve found Li Lu, I won’t look for anyone else. So you’re asking the wrong person. What are the odds of finding someone better than Li Lu? So for me, making this decision is very easy. To answer your question—what you need is Li Lu, but I don’t know where to find another one for you.

**Virtue Attracts Support** 

—By Chang Jin  

I met Li Lu 30 years ago in Beijing. At the time, I was a junior at Peking University, and he was a senior at Nanjing University. About a year later, we met again in San Francisco, USA. Back then, he was a shining star, admitted to Columbia University’s undergraduate college, and his name frequently appeared in major Chinese and English media. I had just arrived in the U.S., living in a poor neighborhood near UC Berkeley, struggling to make a living and feeling lost about the future. At a large local event, he was a speaker on stage, and I was just one of the many audience members. Yet he recognized me in the crowd, walked over, and gave me a warm hug, which deeply moved me. From then on, we became good friends.  
In 1994, I was admitted to Columbia Business School’s MBA program and, by chance, became Li Lu’s classmate. We spent two years studying together at Columbia and graduated together. At graduation, Li Lu earned three degrees simultaneously—a Bachelor’s in Economics from Columbia College, an MBA from the Business School, and a Juris Doctor from the Law School—making him the first student in Columbia’s history to achieve this. He also spoke as the student representative at Columbia’s 1996 graduation ceremony.  
After graduation, he became an investor and founded Himalaya Capital Management just a year later, establishing his own investment fund. I joined a management consulting firm in Boston and, in 1999, left to start a business during the internet boom. After failing, I joined a startup internet media company. In 2006, when I decided to leave that company, Li Lu invited me to join Himalaya Capital. Since then, I have been his business partner, and 13 years have passed in the blink of an eye. In fact, from the time we left business school until I joined Himalaya, our career paths had always intersected. He was my earliest angel investor and a major shareholder in the startup I later joined. After entering the business world, my life path has been closely tied to his, and I have always received his help.  
I often say he is the “three olds” in my life, and people always think I’m joking. When we were young, calling him “old” was indeed somewhat joking, but he was truly mature beyond his years. Now, when I say “three olds,” I am serious: old friend, old boss, and old teacher.  
Calling Li Lu my teacher is not flattery. Li Lu loves reading and is incredibly knowledgeable. He thinks deeply and asks questions as sharp as needles. Any idea or statement with flaws cannot slip past him; they are exposed赤裸裸地. Moreover, he is very straightforward and does not sugarcoat things. Whether you are a close friend or an expert authority, he speaks directly and hits your sore spot, which often offends people.  
When I first started interacting with him, this made me very uncomfortable. I thought he was too “prickly,” too sharp and不留情面. Later, I gradually understood that this is just his personality; he holds no personal grudges but simply cannot help pointing out problems when he sees them. When communicating with him, as long as you open your heart and speak freely, even if we argue until we are red in the face, it’s over afterward—he never holds a grudge.  
Moreover, I slowly discovered that he is almost always more comprehensive in his views, and his perspectives stand the test of time. Especially after working with him, given the nature of our work, there is no room for pretending to understand things you don’t. Thus, my ideas and work have faced more criticism from him. From initial resistance to reflection and adaptation, and eventually to opening my heart and learning from him, I gradually understood that his “intellectual honesty” is not just a learning attitude but a value that drives his continuous improvement in investing and his pursuit of truth in thinking. Looking back today, he taught me not only the essence of value investing and the true meaning of learning and research but also the true meaning of being a person.  
I am grateful for Li Lu’s patience with me over the years, imparting everything he has learned and realized without reservation. If there is anything slightly better than average in my career or thinking, it must be credited to Li Lu’s teachings. Therefore, calling him my teacher is no exaggeration.  
When Li Lu asked me to write a foreword for this collection of his writings, I was actually quite conflicted. Being able to write a foreword for Li Lu’s collection is naturally a great honor in my life. Given Li Lu’s achievements in career and thinking, he is a rare figure among our generation. Especially reaching such heights in both career and thinking is unparalleled in the world I know.

Because we share many life experiences, Li Lu and I have many common interests and topics, one of which is China, particularly why China fell behind in the past and how it can achieve modernization. This question has troubled me for decades, and I never found a good answer, let alone developed a systematic theoretical framework. Like many thoughtful friends, I would occasionally ponder such big questions, gain some insights, and then set them aside without delving deeper. Further reflection would reveal that I hadn’t really thought it through clearly.  
Fortunately, Li Lu has thought much more deeply about this and is willing to share with me, which has benefited me greatly. Looking back on our conversations and discussions over the past ten-plus years, I think his understanding of this issue underwent a qualitative leap around 2008 and 2009. Those two years were precisely when he faced great confusion and challenges in his career and life. At that time, we often strolled, chatted, and shared our thoughts in the Pasadena City Hall garden—though mostly, I listened to him. Naturally, we talked most about China, from history to modernity, from culture to economy. His reading volume is enormous, and his knowledge is extremely broad. Much of the information was things I had never heard before.  
In April 2009, Li Lu had the idea of translating and publishing *Poor Charlie’s Almanack* in Chinese. *Poor Charlie’s Almanack* is a bible-like classic in the value investing community overseas. It encompasses the essence of Mr. Charlie Munger’s lifelong thinking and important speeches, covering not only investing but also learning, thinking, and life. Translating and publishing it required a professional team. Li Lu’s good friend, the renowned writer Liu Liu, strongly supported this idea and introduced us to publisher Mr. Shi Hongjun.  
Mr. Shi Hongjun is a prominent figure in the domestic publishing industry with a keen eye for excellent works. We met in Hong Kong in July to discuss the translation and publication of *Poor Charlie’s Almanack*. In Hong Kong, with the inquisitive Liu Liu present, Li Lu was particularly talkative. He discussed *Poor Charlie’s Almanack* and shared his own insights on investing, life, China, and the world. Since Mr. Munger is himself an encyclopedic figure, and the studious Liu Liu is curious about everything under the sun, asking all sorts of questions, Li Lu answered them all effortlessly. His responses covered finance, business, economics, science, technology, humanities, history, and philosophy—both Eastern and Western. He answered every question with confidence, drawing on classics and offering unique见解, especially his profound understanding of Chinese history, which had already formed a system of its own!  
From mid-July 2009 to the end of March 2010, we focused on translating, proofreading, and revising the Chinese version of *Poor Charlie’s Almanack*. Mr. Shi Hongjun found Mr. Li Jihong to do the translation. After Li Jihong sent us the translated draft, I did the first round of proofreading, followed by Liu Liu’s second round of proofreading and polishing. Finally, Li Lu did the final review before sending it back to the publisher’s editors. We aimed to ensure the translated text accurately conveyed the original meaning and reflected the author’s writing style as much as possible.  
Those who have read *Poor Charlie’s Almanack* know that Mr. Munger’s lifelong research interests extend beyond investing, finance, and business to include various fields of hard and soft sciences. The book contains numerous professional terms, stories and quotes from historical figures, many witty metaphors, and Mr. Munger’s unique language style. Particularly, Mr. Munger is skilled at reverse thinking and dry humor. Coupled with the many subtle differences in thinking patterns between Eastern and Western cultures, without a deep understanding of Mr. Munger’s thoughts, the translation would naturally contain many errors. Thus, even with the preliminary work by Li Jihong, Liu Liu, and me, Li Lu still spent a great deal of time revising and correcting. In fact, without Li Lu’s oversight, the translation quality of the Chinese version of *Poor Charlie’s Almanack* could not have reached its current level. During this period, Li Lu also wrote the foreword for the Chinese version of *Poor Charlie’s Almanack*—*There is Gold in Books*. After publication, this became a long-term online hit. Personally, I believe this was the starting point of his own intellectual explosion.  
On May 5, 2010, Li Lu hosted a private gathering at his home to celebrate the publication of the Chinese version of *Poor Charlie’s Almanack*, inviting friends from various circles in Southern California. The invitation included his Chinese foreword for *Poor Charlie’s Almanack*. After the gathering, a few friends stayed to listen to Li Lu talk about human evolution and China issues. This was the first time I heard him use evolutionary principles to explain cultural formation. I was particularly impressed by a discussion between Li Lu and Mr. Ma Qingyun, then dean of the USC School of Architecture, about architectural design. Li Lu persuasively explained the use of trees and lawns in architectural design based on the influence of geography in human evolution.  
For nearly two years after that, when we strolled and chatted in the Pasadena City Hall garden, he most often talked about how to view various issues from an evolutionary perspective, including investing in China. He detailed for me UCLA professor Jared Diamond’s *Guns, Germs, and Steel*, Stanford professor Ian Morris’s *Why the West Rules—for Now*, British science writer Matt Ridley’s *The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves*, and biologist/anthropologist Edward O. Wilson’s *The Social Conquest* ...
