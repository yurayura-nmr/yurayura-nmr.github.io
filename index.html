    <h2>January 31, 2023</h2>
    <p>Just came back from a great research trip to Germany. Thanks again to all the students who did not mind me doing two classes on Zoom instead of face-to-face. Looking forward to continuing and further expanding our great collaboration in Dresden and co.</p>

    <p>This got a bit late, but congratulations Daichi on your nice practical overview on how to use our Rheo-NMR approach for general biomolecular studies!</p>

    <p>Long time no updates! But finally, something to write here! Yes, yes - good news!</p>
    <p>Our collaborative paper with Dr. Scheler and Benjamin from Dresden was accepted. Look forward to the details soon.</p>
    <p>The journey that culminated in this paper started with a simple observation of our Ph.D. student Naoto several years ago. Naoto observed something peculiar in his aggregation experiments on superoxide dismutase 1.</p>
    <p>You might just have discarded his observations as "poor reproducibility" or "poor handling of the sample". But no! Naoto was sure that something with the experimental setup had triggered faster protein aggregation in some cases than in other cases.</p>
    <p>About five years, a lot of experiments, simulations, and literature study later, we finally began to understand what happened. Anyway, detailed report to follow soon after publication is finalized!</p>
    <p><strong>Flow profile affects the physical properties and behavior of proteins immersed in the solution. In this study, we looked at flow profiles approaching the shape shown in the picture. ;)</strong></p>

    <p>Do not let the scarceness of news on this Sway fool you. We are working on exciting projects and have a couple of studies in the pipeline. :)</p>

    <p><strong>Mayu's summary of our view of non-specific ATP-ATP and ATP-proteins in the vicinity of protein surfaces.</strong></p>
    <p>Mayu's paper on non-specific binding of ATP to proteins and its implications on protein-protein association was published in JACS. Congratulations Mayu!</p>

    <h2>July 12, 2021</h2>
    <p>Naoto's Rheo-NMR paper on folded and unfolded SOD1 was published in JACS. Grand applause and congratulations!</p>
